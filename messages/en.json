    "heading": "Frequently Asked ",
    "headingAccent": "Questions",
    "q1": "How far in advance should I book?",
    "a1": "We recommend booking at least 3-6 months before your event for stationery suites, and 6-12 months for large-scale signage and installations. This ensures ample time for design, revisions, and production. For rush orders, please contact us to discuss availability.",
    "q2": "Do you offer custom designs only, or do you have templates?",
    "a2": "Everything we create is 100% bespoke. We do not use templates. Each design is crafted from scratch based on your unique vision, event details, and personal style. This is what sets Ferya apart.",
    "q3": "What is your pricing structure?",
    "a3": "Pricing varies based on the scope of work, materials chosen, and quantity. Invitation suites typically start from $450, while signage begins at $280. We provide detailed quotes after our initial consultation so there are no surprises.",
    "q4": "Do you ship internationally?",
    "a4": "Yes! We serve clients worldwide. All orders are carefully packaged and shipped via insured courier. International shipping costs and timelines vary by destination and are provided with your quote.",
    "q5": "Can you incorporate cultural elements into the designs?",
    "a5": "Absolutely. Cultural storytelling is at the heart of what we do. We specialize in Islamic geometric art, Arabic calligraphy, and designs that honour diverse cultural traditions. We work closely with you to ensure every element is meaningful and authentic.",
    "q6": "How many revision rounds are included?",
    "a6": "Our standard packages include two rounds of revisions at the concept stage. Additional revisions are available at an hourly rate. Most clients find that two rounds are more than sufficient, as we invest significant time in the initial consultation to understand your vision clearly.",
    "q7": "What materials do you use?",
    "a7": "We work with premium materials including hand-pressed cotton papers, genuine gold and silver foil, premium acrylics, sustainably sourced wood, and archival-quality inks. Specific material options are discussed during the design phase.",
    "q8": "What is your cancellation policy?",
    "a8": "Deposits are non-refundable as they cover initial design work. Cancellations before production begins receive a refund of remaining balance minus the deposit. Once production starts, cancellations are subject to a fee covering materials and labour completed. Full details are provided in our service agreement."
