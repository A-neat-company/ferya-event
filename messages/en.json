    "p1": "Before being a creative house, Ferya is a story of friendship.",
    "p2": "Two childhood friends, bound by the years, shared memories, and a common sensitivity for beauty. Early on, we learned to observe the details: the textures, the colours, the simple gestures that transform an ordinary moment into a treasured memory.",
    "p3": "Our professional paths led us into demanding fields — accounting and software engineering — where rigour, structure, and precision are essential. Yet alongside this, creation has always held a central place. Stationery, decoration, the art of hosting and celebrating have long been our shared language.",
    "p4": "Ferya was born from this natural dialogue between reason and emotion, between mastery and sensitivity.",
    "p5": "We envisioned a creative house where every piece is designed with intention, where nothing is superfluous, and where the detail becomes essential.",
    "p6": "We create pieces destined to accompany life's defining moments: weddings, intimate celebrations, events that carry meaning. Objects you touch, you keep, and that continue to tell a story long after the event.",

    "visionText3": "Every project begins with listening. We take the time to understand your world, your intention, the atmosphere you wish to create.
